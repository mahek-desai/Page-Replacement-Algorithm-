# Page-Replacement-Algorithm-
Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

This project is a Flask-based web application that simulates classic Operating System page replacement algorithms. It provides an interactive frontend where users can input a reference string, choose frame size, and visualize how different algorithms handle page replacement.

Features

Simulates Page Replacement Algorithms (LRU,MRU)

Visualizes memory frames at each step of execution

Tracks page faults for performance analysis

Web-based interface for ease of use

Tech Stack

Backend: Python (Flask)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks: Bootstrap (for responsive UI)

How It Works

Enter a sequence of pages and frame size in the UI.

Select the algorithm (FIFO, LRU, Optimal, etc.).

The system simulates step-by-step execution and shows results with page faults.
